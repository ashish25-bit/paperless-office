   For eg: user 1 => id = 3
           user 2 => id = 1
           chat room id = 1+3(string)
2. User 3 creates the room and if the user 1 also open chat with user, then he will be added to the room 1+3

2. check whether the room is present and if present join the room
3. As soon as both the users leaves the chat room should be canceled
